# LAND-NFS
This is a land numerical forecasting system based on IMLDAS-V2. It was driven by ECMWF forecasting data.
The core land surface model is improved NCAR/CLM3.5. We have made some improvements to enhance the simulation of water and energy cycle.
The initial conditions are from the real-time IMLDAS-V2. 
This system could make a 6 days forecasting of Land. The primary result shows that the soil moisture and snow are better than NCEP/GFS and ECMWF over the Inner Mongolia.

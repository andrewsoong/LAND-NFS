# LAND-NFS
This is a land numerical forecasting system based on IMLDAS-V2. It was driven by ECMWF forecasting data.
The core land surface model is improved NCAR/CLM3.5. We have made some improvements to enhance the simulation of water and energy cycle.
The initial conditions are from the real-time IMLDAS-V2（SONG Haiqing, LI Yunpeng, SHI Chunxiang, YU Yan, SUN Xiaolong, YANG Xiaohua, WU Hao. Impact of Underlying Surface Change on the Numerical Simulation of Soil Moisture in Inner Mongolia of China[J]. Chinese Journal of Atmospheric Sciences, 2016, 40(6): 1165-1181. doi: 10.3878/j.issn.1006-9895.1601.14289）. 
This system could make a 6 days forecasting of Land. The primary result shows that the soil moisture and snow are better than NCEP/GFS and ECMWF over the Inner Mongolia.
